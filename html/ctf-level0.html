	<h4>Level 0</h4>
	<p>
	The instructions for the next level are, of course, top secret.
	Hence, they can only be made available in encrypted form.
	Likewise, we want to ensure that only authorized parties have
	access to these instructions.
	</p>
	<p>
	We accomplish this by using <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">Pretty Good
	Privacy</a> (PGP).  If you don't know how to use PGP yet, maybe <a
	href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=gpg+tutorial">this link</a> will help.
	</p>
	<p>
	Your team needs to send an email encrypted with <a
	href="/public_key.gpg.asc">this key</a> to <a
	href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS615] level 0">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
	with a subject of "[CS615] level 0".  To this
        email, attach a <tt>tar</tt> archive containing:
	<ul>
          <li>a README file containing the name of
              your team as well as key IDs for all
              members</li>
          <li>the public PGP keys for all team
              members, named "$user-key.asc" (where "$user" is the
              Stevens username of the user)</li>
          <li>detached signatures of the README as per
              the <a href="ctf.html">general instructions</a></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	Upon successful completion of this task, all team members will
	receive encrypted instructions on how to proceed to <a
	href="ctf-level1.html">level 1</a>.
