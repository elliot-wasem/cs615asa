        <H2>CS615A -- Aspects of System Administration - Spring 2013 - HW#1</H2>

        <H3>HW#1: Setup your environment for EC2 and create an instance</H3>

        <H4>Summary:</H4>
        <p>
          The objective of this assignment is for you to set up your preferred
          working environment to make it easy for you to interact with the
          Amazon Compute Cloud.  As providing good documentation is an
          important part of System Administration, you should create your own
          reference document that outlines how you set up your environment and
          what steps you need to take to create a new EC2 instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The documentation you write should be theoretically suitable for
          anybody, as a kind of HOWTO.  Please make sure to not include any
          private information.  It is perfectly acceptable for you to
          reference other publicly available documents (and this is preferable
          to you copy-and-pasting other contents into your documentation).
          Likewise, it is perfectly acceptable to publicly ask (and answer!)
          questions, for example in the <a
          href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/forum.jspa?forumID=30">AWS
          Forum</a> or our course mailing list.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to setting up your first instance, you will also
          familiarize yourself with some of the commands relating to filesystems,
          disks and storage as we will discuss in lecture #2.
        </p>
        <p>
          This assignment is worth 25 points.
        </p>

        <H5>Review provided documentation</H5>
        <p>
          Make sure to carefully read through the following documentation:

         </p>

         <H5>Set up your environment</H5>
         <p>
           You need to set up your environment for interaction with the Amazon
           Cloud.  I don't care where you set up your main working environment
           (ie whether or not it's on the <tt>linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu</tt> hosts,
           your private laptop or wherever), but you do need to provide a
           document outlining what steps you took to customize or update your
           setup.  This includes any software installation (on
           <tt>linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu</tt> the Amazon EC2 and related cloud
           tools are already installed under <tt>/opt/ec2tools-1.3</tt>), updating of
           environment variables etc.
         </p>
         <p>
	   Please note that we will only focus on using the command-line
	   tools for EC2.  That is, your HOWTO should describe the setup
	   to use these tools and <em>not</em> how to use the browser
	   based interface.  That is, your documentation will not include
	   sentences like "...then click on..." or "...select from the
           menu..." or anything like that.
         </p>

         <H5>Create an EC2 instance</H5>
         <p>
           Create an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amis/omnios-stable-r151004">OmniOS</a>
           EC2 instance and start it.  Once it is running, log in on the virtual host
           and run the required commands to:
           <ul>
             <li>display basic system information</li>
             <li>display the partition table</li>
             <li>display the currently mounted filesystems</li>
             <li>display available disk space</li>
           </ul>
           After you are done, remember to shut down your instance.
         </p>
         <p>
	   Repeat the same process for a Linux instance (no matter what
           kind or type of Linux).
         </p>

         <H5>Deliverables and Due Date</H5>
         <p>
          Your deliverable is a single flat text file (plain ascii, preferably
          created via a unix editor such as <tt>vi(1)</tt>) named "$USER-hw1"
	  (where "$USER" is your username).  The file needs to contain:
          <ul>
            <li>your full name</li>
            <li>your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt> email address</li>
            <li>reasonably detailed step-by-step instructions on how you set
                up or customized your working environment</li>
            <li>reasonably detailed step-by-step instructions on how to create
                and start an instance of the given OS type and log in</li>
            <li>the output of the following commands run on your running
                instances (ie once for OpenSolaris, once for Linux):
                <ul>
                  <li><tt>uname -a</tt></li>
                  <li><tt>whoami</tt></li>
                  <li><tt>date</tt></li>
                  <li><tt>w</tt></li>
                  <li><tt>ifconfig -a</tt></li>
                  <li><tt>netstat -na</tt></li>
                  <li>the commands you determine to be used to display the
                      partition table, currently mounted filesystems, disk
                      space</li>
                </ul>
             </li>
           </ul>
           </p>
           <p>
             The due date for this assignment is 2012-02-04 18:00.  Please
             attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
             email address to <a
             href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS615] HW1">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
