.Sh NAME
.Nm ec2-backup
.Nd backup a directory into Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hv
.Op Fl e Ar recipient
.Op Fl i Ar instance
.OP Fl m Ar method
.Fl d Ar dir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool performs a backup of the given directory into Amazon Elastic Block
Storage (EBS).
This is achieved by creating a volume of the appropriate size, attaching
it to an EC2 instance and finally copying the files from the given
directory into this volume.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Nm
accepts the following command-line flags:
.Bl -tag -width e_recipient_
.It Fl h
Print a usage statement and exit.
.It Fl e Ar recipient
Encrypt the data for the specified recipient.
.It Fl i Ar instance
Attach the volume in question to the given instance.
.It Fl m Ar method
Use the given method to perform the backup.
Valid methods are 'dd' and 'rsync'; default is 'dd'.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
If not specified,
.Nm
will not generate any output at all (unless an error is encountered).
.El
.Sh DETAILS
.Nm
will perform a backup of the given directory to an ESB volume.
The backup is done in one of two ways: via direct write to the volume
(utilizing
.Xr tar 1
on the local host and
.Xr dd 1
on the remote instance), or via a (possibly incremental) filesystem sync
(utilizing
.Xr rsync 1 Ns ).
.Pp
.Nm
will create a new volume, which will be at least two times the size of
the directory to be backed up.
.Pp
Unless an instance is given using the
.Fl i
flag,
.Nm
will create an instance suitable to perform the backup, attach the volume
in question and then back up the data from the given directory using the
specified method and then shut down the instance it created.
.Sh ENCRYPTION
If
.Fl e Ar recipient
was specified, then
.Nm
will encrypt the data for the specified recipient.
This implies a backup method of 'dd' -- specifying 'rsync' with
.Fl e
is thus an error condition.
.Pp
.Nm
will let the
.Xr gpg 1
tool perform the encryption, and hence recipients are specified in any
manner that
.Xr gpg 1
allows.
Multiple recipients are allowed.
.Sh OUTPUT
Unless the
.Fl v
flag is given,
.Nm
will not generate any output unless any errors are encountered.
Otherwise, it may print out some useful information about what steps it
is currently performing.
.Pp
Any errors encountered cause a meaningful error message to be printed to
STDERR.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
will exit with a return status of 0 under normal circumstances.
If an error occurred,
.Nm
will exit with a value >0.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples illustrate common usage of this tool.
.Pp
To back up the entire filesystem using
.Xr rsync 1 Ns :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ec2-backup -m rsync -d /
.Ed
.Pp
To create a complete backup of the current working directory using
defaults and encrypting for multiple recipients:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ec2-backup -e 6F6BD3D7 -e jschauma@cs.stevens.edu -d .
.Ed

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was originally assigned by
.An Jan Schaumann
.Aq jschauma@cs.stevens.edu
as a homework assignment for the class "Aspects of System Administration" at
Stevens Institute of Technology in the Spring of 2011.
