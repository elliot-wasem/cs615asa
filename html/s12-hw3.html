        <H2>CS615A -- Aspects of System Administration - Spring 2012 - HW#3</H2>

        <H3>HW#3: EC2 Backup</H3>

        <H4>Summary:</H4>
        <p>
          The objective of this assignment is for you to create a tool
	  able to perform a backup of a given directory to a data storage
	  device in the cloud.  In the process, you will (hopefully) learn
	  a few things about writing modular system tools, about the use
	  of some filesystem level helpers and gain some insights into a
	  cloud-based storage model.
        </p>
        <p>
 	  The detailed specification of the program can be found in <a
          href="ec2-backup.txt">this manual page</a> (as well as the
	  <a href="ec2-start-instance.txt">manual page</a> of the
	  helper tool).
        </p>
	<p>
	  This assignment is worth 100 points (75 points for the
	  "ec2-backup" tool, 25 points for the "ec2-start-instance" tool).
        </p>

        <h4>Target platform</h4>
        <p>
	  The tool you write will be executed (and graded) on
	  <tt>lab.cs.stevens.edu</tt>. You are free to develop it
	  in some other environment, but please make sure to test it on
	  <tt>lab.cs.stevens.edu</tt> before submitting it. If it does
	  not work on these hosts, you will not get any points. See also:
	  <a href="hw.txt">general homework guidelines</a>.
	</p>
<!--	<p>
	  The tools you develop will need to be able to work with the
	  following operating systems/AMIs:
          <ul>
            <li>"Getting Started on Fedora Core 8" (AMI Id: ami-b232d0db)</li>
            <li>"Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Base" (AMI Id: ami-19a34270)</li>
            <li>"FreeBSD 8.2" (AMI Id: ami-423bc82b)</li>
            <li>"NetBSD 5.1" (AMI Id: ami-c4ef1dad)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
-->

       <H4>Programming language</h4>
       <p>
	 You are free to choose any programming language you like to implement
	 this tool.  Obviously, the program needs to be executed/run on
	 <tt>linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu</tt> and must not require the additional
	 installation of any tools, libraries etc. besides what is already
	 installed there.
	</p>

       <h4>Program behaviour</h4>
       <p>
	 Your program will not require any modification of the environment
	 (ie, you can assume the user has his/her environment set up for EC2),
	 and exection of the program will be exactly as outlined in the
	 manual pages <a href="ec2-backup.txt">ec2-backup(1)</a> and <a
	 href="ec2-start-instance.txt">ec2-start-instance(1)</a>.
	</p>
       <h4>Notes</h4>
	<p>You may choose to implement the programs in any way you like,
	including breaking it down into smaller individual components.</p>
	<p>You probably want to make sure that your program exhibits the
	various features of good software engineering practices we discussed.
	Please make sure to consider these and have your submission
	reflect wherever possible.</p>
	<p>It is probably in your interest to accompany your sibmission
	with some commentary on why you chose the programming language,
	the approach you took, any considerations you might have.  The
	more thought I see you put into the assignment, the better.</p>
	<p>You may collaborate loosely with other students, but each
	submission must be your own.  This is not a group assignment.</p>
	<p>You may use code you find on the internet <em>if and only
	if</em> you explicitly note which parts are not your own
	<em>and</em> the code in question is licensed such that you can
	use it in this manner.</p>
	<p>This is not a trivial assignment.  Please do not delay starting
	to work on it.</p>

       <H4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
       <p>
	 You will submit a single <tt>tar(1)</tt> archive.  The file to submit
	 will be called "<tt>$USER-hw3.tar</tt>" (where "$USER" is your
	 username).  The archive will extract all files and subdirectories into
	 a directory named <tt>$USER</tt>.
       </p>
       <p>
	 You will only submit source files -- no binaries or executables of
	 any kind.  You may additionally include a single file called
	 <tt>README</tt> in which you may provide commentary on your program.
	 Commentary elaborating on the scalability of the tool in general and
	 your implementation in particular is welcome.
	</p>
	<p>
	 The folllowing is an example sequence of commands to create a valid
	 homework submission:
<pre>
mkdir $USER
cd $USER
vi README
vi ec2-start-instance
[code code code]
vi ec2-backup
[code code code]
cd ..
tar cf $USER-hw3.tar $USER
</pre>
       <p>
         The due date for this assignment is 2012-03-19 18:00.  Please
         attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
         email address to <a
         href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS615] HW3">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
         with a subject of "[CS615] HW3".
