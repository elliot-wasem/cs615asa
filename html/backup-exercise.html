        <H3>Using <tt>dump(8)</tt> and <tt>restore(8)</tt></H3>

	<h4>An incremental restore</h4>
	<p>
	Create an EC2 instance and perform a level 0
	backup of the entire file system using the
	<tt><a
	href="http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?dump++NetBSD-current">dump(8)</a></tt>
	command:
	</p>
	<p><blockquote><tt><pre>$ ssh ec2-instance "/sbin/dump -u -0 -f - /" | bzip2 -c -9 &gt; ec2.0.bz2</pre></tt></blockquote></p>
	<p>Install a webserver using the native
	backage manager and configure it.  Once you
	have everything working, create an incremental
	backup:</p>

	<p><blockquote><tt><pre>$ ssh ec2-instance "/sbin/dump -u -i -f - /" | bzip2 -c -9 &gt; ec2.1.bz2</pre></tt></blockquote></p>

	<p>Inspect the different files and verify that
	the incremental backup contains only a (small)
	subset of the files contained in the complete
	backup.</p>

	<p>Now simulate some data loss:</p>
	<p><blockquote><tt><pre>$ ssh ec2-instance
# pkg_info | wc -l
      14
# rm -f /usr/pkg /var/db/pkg
# echo "Oh no! What a mess!"
# exit
$ </pre></tt></blockquote></p>

	<p>Use your incremental backup to restore the lost files:</p>

	<p><blockquote><tt><pre>$ bzip2 -d -c ec2.1.bz2 | ssh ec2-instance "cd /; /sbin/restore xf -"</pre></tt></blockquote></p>

	<p>Verify that all your software is back in place:</p>
	<p><blockquote><tt><pre>$ ssh ec2-instance /usr/sbin/pkg_info | wc -l</pre></tt></blockquote></p>

	<p>But restoring the full data from the backup
	is a bit of a waste if all you lost was a few
	files.  Delete one or two select files, then
	Use <tt>restore(8)</tt>'s interactive
	mode to only restore exactly those files that
	you deleted.</p>

	<h4>A full restore</h4>

	<p>Next, let's restore the complete filesystem
	into a separate volume:
	create a new volume of the same size
	as the instance file system, create a single
	partition on it, create a new filesystem, and
	mount it on the existing instance under <tt>/mnt</tt>.</p>

	<p>Restore the entire backup into the new
	location.  Note that you will have to apply
	<em>both</em> backups <em>in order</em> to
	recreate the final end state.  Verify that the
	filesystem on the new volume is identical by
	<tt>chroot(8)</tt>ing into <tt>/mnt</tt> and
	e.g., running your usual package utilities in
	there.</p>

	<h4>Restoring to a separate instance</h4>

	<p>We have a full backup of our instance, so
	can we now delete it and later restore it?
	Let's give it a try!</p>

	<p>Terminate the instance and create a new
	one.  Then extract your <em>level 1 backup only</em>
	over the root directory of the new instance.
	Did this bring your new instance into the same
	state as your previous instance was?</p>

	<p>Now revisit the concept of "shareable" vs.
	"unshareable" data as explained in <a
href="https://www.netmeister.org/book/05-software-installation-and-package-management.pdf">our
discussion of Software Installation and Package
Management</a>; how does this apply in this context?
	Can we restore our level 0 backup over the
	new instance?  Give it a try, then reboot
	the instance.</p>

	<P>How could you structure your backup
	strategy to allow for restoration of
	the full filesystem across different
	EC2 instances?</p>
